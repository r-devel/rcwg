subject: R Contributor Office Hours, Thu {month.abb[month(date)]} {day}

Dear All,

The next R Contributor Office Hours are on {weekdays(date)} {month} {day}:

EMEA/APAC, {time[1]}-{add_hours(time[1], 1)} {timezone[1]}: {meetup[1]}
AMER, {time[2]}-{add_hours(time[1], 1)} {timezone[2]}: {meetup[2]}

Meetup sign-up is helpful so we have an idea who to expect, but here are the zoom links to join directly:

EMEA/APAC: {zoom[1]}
AMER: {zoom[2]}

Best wishes,
