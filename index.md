# R Contribution Site

This is a site for people interested in contributing to R core - the code and documentation that gets distributed as base R.

Join our [Slack Group](slack) to chat with current and aspiring R contributors. Everyone interested is welcome!

This site is maintained by the [R Contribution Working Group](working-group), which is working on initiatives to encourage wider contribution to R core. The working group is open to new members ([more information](working-group)).
