## Discussion

### Axel's issue (https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18846)

* Made bug report that Martin reviewed and determined was not a bug, giving a workaround. 
* Axel has tried workaround, but it reveals a new issue! Where should he go with that.
* As it relates to Bioconductor packages, MM suggests to contact Bioconductor devel mailing list, maybe linking to discussion on Bugzilla. See https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel and more generally: https://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/ for other forums.

### Assigned/unassigned labels on R Dev Day GitHub repo

- The R Dev Day Repo is used to prepare bugs for R Dev Days: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues
- So far, issues have been tagged by event, e.g. `LatinR 2024`, `RSECon24`
- Starting to assign issues in between Dev Days, so added following labels:
    - `Assigned`: could also use during Dev Days, but for now using when assigning an ad hoc issue
    - `Unassigned`: could be used to help flag issues that are not actively being worked on.

### `ngettext()` usage

`ngettext()` works best when looking up declension forms for use with a cardinal number in the same sentence, e.g. `%d files processed`. When used to look up generic plural forms (e.g. `ngettext(n, "File processed", "Files processed")`), it still follows the declension rules for cardinal numbers; it is not designed to understand that a generic plural translation should be looked up instead.

In some languages, e.g. Arabic with `nplurals=6`, this requires the translator to spell out the generic plural form 5 times. In other languages without a declension form for `n==1` specifically, this requires translating `File(s) processed` for the case that includes `n==1`.

It turns out that there are two such uses in R's C code and 133 in the R code.

Currently, `gettext` manual even recommends this usage, but Bruno Haible told me on IRC that it's not correct ([follow-up mailing list post](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gettext/2025-02/msg00000.html)).

ngettext() works correctly when the text includes the number in the output message, but it may not make sense when the number does not appear, e.g. following would be wrong in Russian if length(output) happened to be 21, because it would choose the singular form, but that does not make sense when 21 is not in the sentence

```r
ngettext(length(output), "Output/used file:  ", "Output/used files:  ")
```

One solution is to change the sentences to always include %d (or equivalent).
- Maybe could add tool to direct incorrect use of ngettext (without %d)

Ivan suggested to use if/else in the R code:

```r
if (n == 1) gettext("singular form") 
else gettext("plural form")
```

If solving in a programmtic way, would want to avoid having to change ngettext() calls that already work correctly.

Can also see what others do, e.g.
