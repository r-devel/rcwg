## Discussion

### Enabling strings for Windows installer to be added to Weblate (isse on R Dev Day repo: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/19)

Avinab is able to build R and the Windows installer locally without any changes to the source code. They then tried to make changes as suggested in the issue, but now building the installer is failing.

Steps followed:

1. Generated .islu Files:
    - Extracted language-specific custom messages from CustomMsg.iss.
    - Created individual .islu files for each language (e.g., en.islu, fr.islu, etc.).
    - Transferred these .islu files to the Languages folder in the Inno Setup installation directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\Languages).
2.  Updated header1.iss:
    - Modified the [Languages] section in header1.iss to reference both standard .isl files and the new .islu files, e.g.:
    - Name: "en"; MessagesFile: "compiler:Default.isl,compiler:Languages\en.islu"
3. Attempted to Build:
    - Did not save error message but it was something to do with user properties/permissions

Environment Details:  
R source branch: R-4.4.x branch from SVN.  
Tools installed: Inno Setup (at C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6) and Rtools.  
PATH includes Inno Setup and Rtools directories.  

Notes from collaborative debugging:

 - Version of Inno Setup is Unicode (all versions >=6 are unicode) per https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=unicode#:~:text=If%20you%20don't%20remember,are%20running%20Unicode%20Inno%20Setup.

 - The following is from an AI summary and may need confirmation

    > Here's a more detailed explanation:
    > 
    > .isl (ANSI): These files are used for traditional, single-byte character sets (ANSI) in Inno Setup language files. 
    >
    > .islu (Unicode):These files are used for Unicode (UTF-8) encoding, which allows for a much wider range of characters, including those used in languages beyond English. 
    >
    > Purpose:Both file types serve the same purpose: to store the translated text for Inno Setup installers, but .islu is necessary for Unicode support. 
    > 
    > Inno Setup Version:If you are using an Unicode version of Inno Setup, you should use the .islu extension for your language files. 
    >
    > LanguageCodePage:In the [LangOptions] section of your .iss file, you can specify the LanguageCodePage to convert the text in the .isl file to Unicode. If no code page exists for the language, you should set LanguageCodePage to 0, use the .islu extension and encode the file as Unicode.

- Suggest to try again after making only minimal change to the sources
    - Perhaps remove Korean messages from CustomMessages.iss and instead try to link to the existing Korean.isl file in the R sources.
        - Can you build the installer then?
        - Are the Korean messages found? (Assuming installer builds, is Korean available in the languages that you can select during the installation?)
- If still face problems:
    - Report back on #working-out-loud, quoting error message you get when you try to build (if any)
    - Share a diff of the R sources using `svn diff` so others can reproduce your changes locally to investigate further

### R Dev Days

https://contributor.r-project.org/events/r-dev-days/

- Will be some travel scholarship available for the R Dev Day at RSECon25

     - full scholarships for people from the Global South
     - partial scholarships for UK/Europe
     - (Not covering all countries as RSECon25 participants are mainly from the UK, with some participants from Europe and very few from elsewhere. Also there are other R Dev Days planned in other countries, particularly the US, potentially in Australia/New Zealand later in the year).
    - schlarships should be announced next week
    - will prioritise people in research software engineering roles


### Google Summer of Code 

* https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects
   - Deadline early April
   - One on R Dev Container: https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/Refining-the-R-Dev-Container
