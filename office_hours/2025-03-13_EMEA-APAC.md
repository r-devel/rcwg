## Discussion

### R Dev Projects

* Google Summer of Code
    - Further work on the R Dev Container https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/Refining-the-R-Dev-Container
    - More projects (related to R packages): https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects
        
* Outreachy (Bioconductor)
    - https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/bioconductor/

        - Possibly too late for June round, think mentees need to apply to Outreachy first before they can apply for a project. But there are two rounds a year and Bioconductor has been participating regularly

   
*  More opportunities for volunteering!

    - contributing on an ad-hoc basis: help to find issues at the Office Hours, or via Slack

    - R Dev Days, mostly as satellite to conferences: https://contributor.r-project.org/events/r-dev-days/
            - Will be full scholarships on offer for RSECon25 + R Dev Day on Sep 12, for R developers in the Global South - should be advertised in next week. Priority will be for people working in research software engineering roles.


### R Jobs

* #jobs-opportunities on the R Contributor Slack
* r-sig-jobs mailing list: https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-jobs
* other forums: https://contributor.r-project.org/r-help, e.g. data science learning community: https://dslc.io/ #work_jobs_hiring_advice

### Issue with invisible()

* Ella has possible "is it a bug?" question, but doesn't have a reprex at the moment.
  - Issue is with using `invisible()` when you want to return early from a function
  - Looking at `?invisible` and `?function`, looks like the solution may be wrapping in a return statement, i.e. `return((invisible(...))`.

### AI-assisted coding

* Ella has been using Claude to review the design of an R package - gave some useful feedback! E.g. improving default arguments in a function, suggestions for splitting up a complex function. Requires paid access to share a project (bunch of files).
