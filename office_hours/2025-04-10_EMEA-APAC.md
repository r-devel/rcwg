Name:  Ella Kaye    
Country I am currently in: UK  
Something we could do or discuss together today: promoting `penguins` in datasets and basepenguins package, http://cran.r-project.org/package=basepenguins, https://ellakaye.github.io/basepenguins
    
## Discussion

### Adding binary format constant to R

* R has hexadecimal format (e.g. 0xabc), but currently no binary format.
* Tomasz has prototype implementing this (see also #work-out-loud channel)
* Suggest to raise on R-devel mailing list for discussion.
   - Can attach patch to show
* Victor: is it possible to develop in package first?
   - TG: at package level, could implement via strings, but working at the low level would allow you to do more. Has some ideas e.g. to make printed binary numbers easier to read.
   
### Penguins datasets

* Datasets from palmerpenguins package will be in R from version 4.5.0. Want to do push to promote it 
* Base version has slightly different (shorter) column names, which means it's not so easy to switch. Ella has written new package, https://ellakaye.github.io/basepenguins (now on CRAN!) that helps update a script/directory of scripts.
  - Do plan a blog post for later
  - Best to post on personal account then R Contributors can re-post (Mastodon, will be bridged to BlueSky)
      - wait for Peter Dalgaard to post on Bluesky and/or email to R-announce mailing list


### Communication: difference between R-devel mailing list and Slack

- R Contributors Slack is intended to be a forum for more informal discussions (that don't need to involve everybody!) and a friendly place for new contributors in particular
     - Some things only happen on R Contributors: promoting R Contribution Working Group meetings, office hours and wider R community events, sharing job/project opportunities, groups discussons for particular projects (e.g. Google summer of Code), mentoring when working on an issue (through #work-out-loud
 - R-devel mailing list is official forum for technical discussions about base R, has much more involvement from developers on the R Core Team
    - Good for discussing potential new features, things that might be a bug, etc. 
    - Recommend subscribing and following discussions if interested in contributing regularly to base R
 - R Dev Days are promoted on both 
 - Office hours can be good place to discuss which forum is best for what (sometimes the Bugzilla bug tracker can be a better place to report a bug/raise a wishlist item).
