    - Find good issues on rOpenSci packages via this page: https://ropensci.org/help-wanted/

    - Bioconductor, might be worth joining Zulip and asking: https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-05-29-slack-to-zulip/index.html

    - Make a change on a fork of the repo and make a pull request, see https://github.com/forwards/first-contributions.

    - Look out for Developer events, Tidyverse Dev Days, e.g. https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/04/tdd-2024/
