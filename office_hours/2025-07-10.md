## Discussion

### rep messages

* "invalid 'times' argument"

    * times must either be  length 1 or `length(x) * each` [not just length(x)]. This is in details but not in the parameter documentation or the error message

    * "invalid 'times' argument" -> must be  length 1 or `length(x) * each`. Or invalid interaction between times and each.

    * BUT "invalid 'times' argument" is fine when only times is wrong

     * rep() is a primitive function

         - should only do extra work once you know there is an error,

    * rep() is a generic - `times` and `each` may only be defined for default method.
     * Martin Maechler happy to see proposal to change error message and help page. Try to avoid duplication.
     * Source code is in: src/main/seq.c, do_rep

         * get error message  line 675

         * current message minimises translation as reusues 

            `errorcall(call, _("invalid '%s' argument"), "times")`

         * make error message a translatable string by using `_("string")

         * need to check cases

    * Patch shouldn't add white space changes!

    * Would make nice issue for next dev day!


### R Dev Days

 * Reviewing some worked on at R Dev Day @ Rencontres R 2025 
    * https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/91
        * tolerance should be relative (what happens to proposed tolerance if example data is multiplied by 10, 1e10, or 1e100, 1e-100 etc. Tolerance needs to scale with the data, i.e., be a *relative* tolerance.
    * https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/92
        * check with Toby if proposal is ready to post back on Bugzilla
 * Check HELP WANTED tags on Bugzilla for other potential issues.

### Misc

 * Document correct settings for VS Code and Positron [post edit: opened as dev day issue with more refined settings: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/105]
