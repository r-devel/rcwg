## Discussion

### Package development

Abhay has been attending Forwards package development workshop to learn more.

### R Bugs on Bugzilla

 - Sometimes patches have a lot of white space changes which make them diffficult to review, e.g. https://bugs.r-project.org/attachment.cgi?id=3444&action=diff
 
 - In VS Code/Positron [post edit: opened as dev day issue with more refined settings: r-devel/r-dev-day#105]
            "settings": {
                "editor.tabSize": 8,
                "editor.indentSize": 4,
                "editor.detectIndentation": false,
            },
 - In vim, this might help: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2054782 [post edit: could use .editorconfig instead as in: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/104]
 - See e.g. `/src/library/stats/R/termplot.R` where there is a mix of spaces and tabs
 - Is there a way to restrict to a particular project/directory (so doesn't affect other work)
 
 ### Quartz segfaults
 - Get a segfault when press Command+P (R>=4.5.0 and load xml2 library first)
 - Reproducible on both Intel and ARM-based Mac
 - Possible issue for R Dev Day at useR!  (will be on August 11, so collecting good issues).
 - See Quartz hanging thread on r-sig-mac mailing list.
