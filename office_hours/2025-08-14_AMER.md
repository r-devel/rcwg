### Preparing for R Dev Day 

 - Simsani will be coming to R Dev Day @ RSECon25
     - R Dev Day issues: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues

          - Selected bugs from Bugzilla, with extra pointers to get started

     - Working on Documentation: 
            - editing a single file can be easier through GitHub, see https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/chapters/lifecycle_of_a_patch.html#using-a-git-mirror.
            - editing a page of the R Dev Guide, click "edit this page" on the right hand side of a page to go straight to the markdown file to edit. Make changes on a branch and then make a pull request.
      - Useful resources to prepare: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/blob/main/participant_resource_list.md
