## Discussion

### R macOS app

- TG is working through the book "Cocoa programming for macOS 10", since the macOS GUI for R uses objective C, like this book
- We have some translations on Weblate server for macOS app, TG would like to add Polish translations. Have done automated translations, they may need to be approved (appearing as approved on Weblate already!).
- Looks like translations contributed to the Mac GUI component on Weblate are not being contributed back to the original source repo (https://github.com/R-macos/Mac-GUI)

    - Suggest to check in with Mike Chirico and Gergely Daroczi on the R Contributors Slack

- TG has made PR: https://github.com/R-macos/Mac-GUI/pull/16

    - HT can ping Simon about this.


### R Internals

- MR has been exploring R internals and has some questions!
    - What is a symbol? A piece of data that doesn't get deallocated by the garbage collector.
