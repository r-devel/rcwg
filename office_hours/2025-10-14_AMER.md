## Discussion

## Bindings for Rust

- A lot of Rust package developers want to add R and Python bindings for their Rust package
- Do this by putting R package in subdirectory of rust crate, e.g. bindings/r.
- This causes problems with remotes::install_github
- Using R CMD INSTALL directly seems to work
- Maybe work around by making rust crate a dummy package with a configure script that calls R CMD INSTALL?
