## Discussion

## Changes to configure.ac

- Started from discussions R Dev Day @ RSECon25
- configure script sets up information about system ready to build R and R packages

    - [configure.ac script](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/main/configure.ac) creates configure script

- Motivations for editing: 

    - If have C, Obj-C, Fortran code in your package, will be compiled to object file. Intermediate files are filtered out and not included in build

 - Nightly builds of R-devel on mac: https://mac.r-project.org/
 - Test across platforms using git mirror: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn, https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/chapters/lifecycle_of_a_patch.html#using-a-git-mirror
  - build script on r-svn mirror uses sed to workaround SVN version: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/main/.github/examples/build-r-macos.sh
  - alternative instructions for building R on macOS, including variations if you're using Git mirror: https://github.com/r-devel/rcwg/blob/main/working_documents/install_r_macos.md
