## Discussion

### Issue brought by Hugo Gruson in EMEA office hour

 - Using braces in definition of setGeneric() affects its performance, see details in EMEA-APAC office hour minutes: https://github.com/r-devel/rcwg/blob/main/office_hours/2025-12-11_EMEA-APAC.md
 - ML: when you have brace function you're using the R evalutor which slows things down vs just using the standard generic
     - easiest way is not to use the braces
     - maybe something could be changed at a low level in general
     - to take forward: best to email r-devel to see what people think, good recent example: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2025-November/084230.html

 ### S7

 - EK: What's the current status in terms of integrating with base R?
 - ML: There is good buy-in for this amongst R core
     - Some changes made in base R to allow arbitrary new object-oriented system to be added in.
     - There are still some outstanding issues, e.g. working on compatibility with S4. Mainly relying on contributors from Posit -  expecting a push in the new year that could allow plan for integration into base R.
     - Has been a good collaboration with Luke Tierney, Michael Lawerence, Posit, and lots of other folks

### Wishlist item from Hugo in EMEA office hour

- Would be good to have a way to know in which R version specific features became effective.
    -  See details in EMEA-APAC office hour minutes: https://github.com/r-devel/rcwg/blob/main/office_hours/2025-12-11_EMEA-APAC.md
- The other GitHub mirror https://github.com/wch/r-source/ does have tagged releases on branches, e.g. https://github.com/wch/r-source/tree/tags/R-3-3-3.
- Would have been good if Ella had got an example from Hugo to understand motivation! Need some examples, especially of a change that wasn't in NEWS.
- Could ask Jeroen (who set up the r-svn mirror), if we could track the other branches of the svn repo (which is where the tagged releases are, https://svn.r-project.org/R/tags/)
- If the changes is in NEWS, can use `news()` which can be subset by version - could be good to have an example to add to the R Dev Guide.
- EK to ask Hugo to discuss in Slack, with examples (might not be an R Core issue, maybe more RCWG)
