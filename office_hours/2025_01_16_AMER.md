## Discussion

* Mikael has been talking to Kurt about a tool for reverse dependency checking.

    - hopefully users would then be able to use same process that CRAN does

    - would be in scope for RSMF even though this is a new feature and CRAN focused


* Gabe did some previous work creating a "just-in-time repo" that contains all the relevant packages whether they are local/CRAN/GitHub

* Also relates to a project Gabe plans to work on that would install dependencies when installing a package from a source tarball.

* Reviewed a working document resulting from Birdaro training.
