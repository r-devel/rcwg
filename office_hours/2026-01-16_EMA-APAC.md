## Discussion

* Mossa has been working on a big upgrade of extendr using AI tools

* Mossa has been exploring ways to handle "unwinding" memory allocations in combined R and Rust code. A couple of strategies:
    1. Running R and Rust in separate threads, so each language can be managed separately
    2. Modifying the Rust compiler to provide a finaliser to manage releasing the memory used by R
    
* Both Ella and Mossa have been experimenting with S7
   - multiple dispatch is a good advantage over S3, enabling method to depend on class of multiple arguments not just the first one
   - computed properties, a property that is computed on demand: https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/articles/classes-objects.html#computed-properties
       - Ella is using in this package: https://github.com/ellakaye/jugglr
       - this is called an active binding in R6
       
* Mossa has been trying to reduce compile time of R. The configure script includes tools you can use in your configuration - one of these is a linker called libtool. But in practice R does not use libtool, but rather gcc or clang. And there a lot of tests associated with libtools. There is also `R CMD link` that does require libtool. Discussed this on the #work-out-loud channel (https://r-contributors.slack.com/archives/C01EVRJRYA0/p1765577814669169?thread_ts=1765517623.679399&cid=C01EVRJRYA0).
    - gcc should be good enough to support legacy system
    - not used in build system
    - JAGS is using libtool
    - R CMD link could use gcc or clang instead (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/packages/utils/refman/utils.html#LINK)
    - Not as simple as taking out libtool won't compile straight away, need to make changes in make file.
    
* Mossa has also found some small issues, e.g. missing BREAK statements in switch calls and issues with colliding code when C code is copied over elsewhere etc.
    - Better to start with these smaller issues, to build up portfolio of contributions before tackling a bigger change
