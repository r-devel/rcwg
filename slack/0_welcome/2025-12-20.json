Over the past period, I have worked extensively in RStudio, building and experimenting with projects that span data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical summarization, and visualization pipelines.\nMy work in R has involved designing structured analysis workflows, automating repetitive data preparation tasks, and using packages such as dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, and janitor to produce clean, interpretable outputs from raw datasets. I have also focused on writing readable, modular R scripts and developing a habit of validating assumptions through summaries, tabulations, and sanity checks.\nThrough these projects, I developed a practical understanding of:\n Handling real-world, imperfect datasets\n Building reproducible analysis pipelines\n Interpreting statistical outputs rather than treating them as black boxes\n Debugging and understanding package-level behavior\nI am now looking to contribute back by engaging with issues, documentation improvements, tests, and small feature enhancements, while learning established conventions used in R packages and the broader CRAN ecosystem. My goal is to grow as a contributor by writing clear, maintainable R code and collaborating constructively within open-source communities.",
