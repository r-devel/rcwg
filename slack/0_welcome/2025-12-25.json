I enjoy working with statistics, experimenting with data, and understanding how good software enables scientific computing at scale. I come from a strong *tech and problem-solving background*—I enjoy *competitive programming*, working through logical challenges, and building things step by step. Recently, I’ve been getting more serious about *open-source development*, and contributing to R feels like a natural next step for me. I’m eager to learn the R contribution workflow, understand the codebase better, and start contributing in whatever way is most helpful—whether that’s documentation, testing, small fixes, or anything beginner-friendly. I’m especially interested in learning best practices from maintainers and mentors here.",
