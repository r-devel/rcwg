The survey takes about 10–15 minutes, and your input would help a lot with my PhD research.\n:point_right: Survey link:\n<https:\/\/oregonstate.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV_3JKz3jwJvUkVIOi>\nThanks a lot for your time, and feel free to share the link with other developers if you’d like! :blush:",

In particular, we are studying how the use of AI tools affects team dynamics and the emergence of social anti-patterns in developer teams.\n\nWe are aware that your time is precious. Nevertheless, gathering your opinions—through a systematic research process—is the only way to give them importance and visibility. We would be grateful if you could invest time in completing them.\n\nMore information about the survey:\n\nThe estimated time of completion of this full survey is 10\/15 minutes\n\nWe will collect and analyze your answers only in an anonymized form.\n\nThanks in advance for your effort and time!",
