For example, suppose that I create a unit object as follows: `oneinch &lt;- convertUnit(unit(1, \"inches\"), \"native\")`. Now if I resize the device, the unit object in `oneinch` no longer corresponds to a physical length of 1 inch.\nWhen you zoom the plot in your example, the x location of the lower point and the width and height of the lower rectangles get defined according to the resized device size as they're defined in \"npc\" units. The x location of the upper point and the width and height of the upper rectangles remain at the length in inches that was computed before the device was resized.\n\nThe RStudio issue is different - there the conversion doesn't match even without any resizing (the `grid.newpage()` creates a clean slate and we would expect the points to vertically align and the rectangles to be the same size if we don't do any resizing after that).\n\nI'll add this comment to the RStudio issue.",
