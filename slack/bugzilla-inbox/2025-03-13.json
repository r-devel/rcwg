Do you know how long it takes to install\n&gt; those 300+ packages?\n\nAs Peter wrote, uninstalling R doesn't uninstall packages. Your packages would\nbe normally installed in a directory like\n\"C:\/Users\/&lt;username&gt;\/AppData\/Local\/R\/win-library\/4.4\". If you uninstall R 4.4.1\nand then install it again, that directory will not be affected, you will find\nall your packages there after installation. And this directory will be used by\nR 4.4.x (for all x), so possibly multiple installations of R.\n\n&gt; Clean installer should handle this correctly. There is definitely room for\n&gt; improvement.\n\nHow this works technically is that an R installer sets file associations on\ninstallation and removes them on uninstallation. So, considering install and\nuninstall of various versions of R: if the last operation was uninstall, there\nwould be no .Rdata association; if the last operation was install, .Rdata would\nbe associated to the R version installed in that last install operation.\n\nThis is not easy to change. And it is not easy to even say what would be\nbetter. Someone might want to, at uninstall, to set the association to the\npreviously installed R (someone to previously installed from now, someone to\ninstalled before the one being uninstalled). Someone else to the latest version\nof R installed. Someone possibly to something else (e.g. take into account also\nwhether the installations are per-user or the whole system, possibly take into\naccount whether native or emulated on aarch64). The current implementation has\nthe advantage that it is simple, and has been around for long, so users got\nused to it. Like the other options, it wouldn't make everyone happy, but at\nleast one wouldn't end up running an unexpected version of R (as the\nassociation is deleted).\n\n&gt; PS: Unfortunatelly, manual modification of the registry is currently the\n&gt; only way to do it without having to reinstall the R version you intend to\n&gt; keep.\n\nWhen the association is deleted on the uninstall of R operation, you can use\nWindows explorer to navigate to the .Rdata file at hand, click open, navigate\nto the version of R you want to use (possibly to Rgui,exe within that version),\nand that would open your file as well as set the association. I've tested now\non my Windows 10 this still works.\n\nBut, yes, modifying the registry entry is also a valid solution and some might\nprefer that.\n\nIn principle, if you ever again run into a similar problem to this one, I would\nrecommend you ask on R-help mailing list rather than the forum you used. I\nbelieve you would get a helpful advice there within a day.",
