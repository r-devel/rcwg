However, there are checks in place for that, one should see a warning\nwhen the module cannot be loaded, and then one should get an error when calling\na LAPACK function (already in 3.2.3). Interestingly, deleting the objects and\nthen running gc() several times to clean up the memory doesn't help - LAPACK\nroutines still return NULL."
