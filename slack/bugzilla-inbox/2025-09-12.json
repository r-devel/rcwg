What the\nclass attribute contains is only a part of the story. This is something that\ncannot be realistically changed.\n\nclass(1L) returns \"integer\", which is an implicit class in this case taken from\nthe \"type\" as in typeof(). There is no \"class\" attribute.\n\nWhen one computes 1L\/1.0, the result is a value of \"type\" (as in typeof())\ndouble, again no class attribute is involved or even present.\n\nEven when the class attribute is present, the default implementation of the\narithmetic operations ignores it, it works on the \"type\" as in typeof() (See R\nLanguage Definition).\n\nSo,\n\nstructure(class=c(\"myclass\", \"character\"), 1L)\/10.0\n\nstill divides an integer (1L) by a double (10.0) and leaves the class attribute\nalone. This could perhaps be even more surprising, but this is because the\nclass attributes are \"above\" the types of the values.\n\nI would myself avoid using the implicit class names as explicit in the class\nattribute to avoid confusion, and the R Language Definition warns against\nmodifying the class attribute directly.\n\nRe the example in the original report,  \"class(y2) # c(\"myclass\", \"integer\") -\nnot propagated to c(\"myclass\", \"numeric\")\"\n\nNot knowing R I would actually have expected something else. If using some\ndefault method for dividing an integer by a numeric, I would expect the result\nto be a plain \"numeric\" - how could the default method know about \"myclass\" nor\nhow could it create one?",

Specifying default value for ratio argument.\n2. Modifying details to be clearer. In particular, it was not clear if the\nratio was var_X\/var_Y or var_Y\/var_X. We also added details when lm objects are\npassed.\n3. Add an example for the formula group method for testing the equality of\nvariances between two groups from the same population. \n\nJoint work by Luis Verde Arregoitia, Eren Ozberk, Jyoti Bhogal, Emanuel\nCiardullo, and Louis Aslett. Sebastian Meyer kindly provided initial feedback\nwhich has been incorporated."

That would be another issue, and a\n\"wishlist\" primarily.\n\nAlso, this has no immediate value to me nor application in stats I would know\nof.\n\nStill, as I just mentioned else where, I'm currently working on providing\n`log1p()`  and  `expm1()`  working -- numerically stably! -- for complex\narguments.\n\nI definitely do *not* need a patch to fix this.\n\nPossibly someone could systematically check all functions in\n\n```\n&gt; getGroupMembers(\"Math\")\n [1] \"abs\"      \"sign\"     \"sqrt\"     \"ceiling\"  \"floor\"    \"trunc\"   \n [7] \"cummax\"   \"cummin\"   \"cumprod\"  \"cumsum\"   \"exp\"      \"expm1\"   \n[13] \"log\"      \"log10\"    \"log2\"     \"log1p\"    \"cos\"      \"cosh\"    \n[19] \"sin\"      \"sinh\"     \"tan\"      \"tanh\"     \"acos\"     \"acosh\"   \n[25] \"asin\"     \"asinh\"    \"atan\"     \"atanh\"    \"cospi\"    \"sinpi\"   \n[31] \"tanpi\"    \"gamma\"    \"lgamma\"   \"digamma\"  \"trigamma\"\n```\n... which interestingly, has never contained  `beta()` and  `lbeta()`.\n\nMost \"Math\"-functions are documented to work with complex, notably `abs(.)`\n(defined as `Mod(.)` already in S),\n `exp()` and  `log()`, but also all\ntrigonometric and \"hyperbolic\" functions including their inverses.\n\nThe list above will remind (some of) us, that indeed, `ceiling()`, `floor()`\nand `trunc()`  could\/should probably be implemented,\nnot trivially though because there's no complete ordering of complex numbers.",

Maybe this is rather a case for external measures, such\nas backup.\n\nThe biggest problem of potentially changing the default behavior to using\nrecycle bin is that files moved to the recycle bin still occupy disk space.\nWhile it is possible to set up automated cleaning of the recycle bin, not all\nsystems would be set up like that and user programs would start running out of\ndisk space. Also, that files deleted by file.remove() are hard to restore and\ncannot be reliably restored can sometimes been seen as an advantage, e.g. when\ndeleting sensitive data. User expectations would match the current behavior\nwhen file.remove() is \"permanent\". \n\nDeleting files via a recycle bin, say on Windows and macOS, could be an\noptional feature or a special deletion function. It could also support some\nmode for Unix systems, perhaps as suggested, by moving to a temporary session\ndirectory or implementing some custom recycle bin.\n\nI don't think this should be in base R. Python has a module for this\n(Send2Trash). Perhaps this is something what could be implemented in a package\nfor those who wish to use it.\n\nNow, as such feature would have to be opt-in, anyway, perhaps one could also\nestablish a practice of using File Explorer when deleting important files\nmanually, rather than calling file.remove() from R.",

Maybe this is rather a case for external measures, such\nas backup.\n\nThe biggest problem of potentially changing the default behavior to using\nrecycle bin is that files moved to the recycle bin still occupy disk space.\nWhile it is possible to set up automated cleaning of the recycle bin, not all\nsystems would be set up like that and user programs would start running out of\ndisk space. Also, that files deleted by file.remove() are hard to restore and\ncannot be reliably restored can sometimes been seen as an advantage, e.g. when\ndeleting sensitive data. User expectations would match the current behavior\nwhen file.remove() is \"permanent\". \n\nDeleting files via a recycle bin, say on Windows and macOS, could be an\noptional feature or a special deletion function. It could also support some\nmode for Unix systems, perhaps as suggested, by moving to a temporary session\ndirectory or implementing some custom recycle bin.\n\nI don't think this should be in base R. Python has a module for this\n(Send2Trash). Perhaps this is something what could be implemented in a package\nfor those who wish to use it.\n\nNow, as such feature would have to be opt-in, anyway, perhaps one could also\nestablish a practice of using File Explorer when deleting important files\nmanually, rather than calling file.remove() from R."
