This is useful\ne.g. for exporting model statistics or plotting. Currently we need something\nlike:\n\n```\nfit &lt;- lm(breaks ~ wool * tension, warpbreaks)\n\ncf &lt;- fit |&gt; summary() |&gt; coef()\nci &lt;- confint(fit)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(row.names(cf), cf, ci, row.names = NULL)\nnames(df) &lt;- c(\"term\", \"estimate\", \"std.error\", \"statistic\", \"p.value\",\n\"conf.low\", \"conf.high\")\ndf\n#             term  estimate std.error statistic      p.value   conf.low \nconf.high\n# 1    (Intercept)  44.55556  3.646761 12.217842 2.425903e-16  37.223250 \n51.887861\n# 2          woolB -16.33333  5.157299 -3.167032 2.676803e-03 -26.702779 \n-5.963888\n# 3       tensionM -20.55556  5.157299 -3.985721 2.280796e-04 -30.925001\n-10.186110\n# 4       tensionH -20.00000  5.157299 -3.877999 3.199282e-04 -30.369445 \n-9.630555\n# 5 woolB:tensionM  21.11111  7.293523  2.894501 5.698287e-03   6.446501 \n35.775721\n# 6 woolB:tensionH  10.55556  7.293523  1.447251 1.543266e-01  -4.109055 \n25.220166\n```\n\nI understand that `as.data.frame()` methods may not be the best way. Here is an\nattempt to summarise what has been discussed:\n\n| interface | pros | cons |\n| - | - | - |\n| `as.data.frame(lm(.))` | short | not explicit (see comment 4) |\n| `as.data.frame(summary(lm(.)))` or `summary(lm(.), data.frame = TRUE)` | more\nexplicit ? | `summary.lm()` does not return confidence intervals, so returning\nit in the data frame is counterintuitive |\n| `collect_stats(lm(.))` | short and can be explicit if function name is good\nenough | ? |",
