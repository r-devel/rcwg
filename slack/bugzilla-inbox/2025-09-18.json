It is hence natural that they are also used when linking the R library, even\nvia the .pc file, with such installation of R. With this design, it cannot be\nexpected that such installation of R would work without the libraries specified\nin LDFLAGS.\n\nI think this was a valid design decision (and at least not obviously badly\nwrong), and this design has been in use for many years - changing it now could\nbreak things for system administrators, maintainers of software distributions,\nsome users, etc.\n\nIf this design doesn't fit well to some software distribution, I think it is\nbest to patch it there by the distribution maintainers, who know best what they\nneed in their distribution.

Not difficult, but a helper\nwould be nice. \n\n&gt; Wouldn't it be simpler to add an option to summary() to include the confidence intervals?\n\nI like this proposal. What about\n\n```\nfit |&gt;\n    summary(<http:\/\/conf.int|conf.int> = 0.95) |&gt; # return 95% confidence interval\n    coef(data.frame = TRUE) # return a data frame with syntactic names and\nterms as a column\n```\n\n?\n\nHappy to provide a patch if R-core is interested!",

The -L and -l flags are\nstandard,\n\n<https:\/\/pubs.opengroup.org\/onlinepubs\/9799919799\/utilities\/c17.html>\n\nbut many other flags are specific to a certain linker. If you record any\nnon-portable flags in pkg-config, then using another linker to link against\nlibr becomes impossible.\n\nPicking a random example from the man pages...\n\n  $ ld.lld --call-graph-profile-sort=hfsort\n\nworks, but\n\n  $ ld.bfd --call-graph-profile-sort=hfsort\n  ld.bfd: unrecognized option '--call-graph-profile-sort=hfsort'\n  ld.bfd: use the --help option for usage information\n\nUnless you are very careful about what you add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, I would be\nwary of creating a security issue by making it possible to load code from a\ndirectory that other people can write to. I can $(mktemp) securely, build some\nlibrary there, and then link R against it. If I install the library and reboot,\nwill R try to load code from the old, now world-writable path that is visible\nin the .pc file? (This is just a variation on the old PATH=\".\" issue.)",
