I've fixed this in a development version of Rtools, the\ncmake files are patched to avoid full paths. To appear in the upcoming Rtools45\nupdate.\n\nThe paths you found are not relative, they are absolute (but indeed, still\nwrong). In addition to the problem you found in GDAL-targets.cmake, there was a\nproblem in the NetCDF targets file as well, that brought in the full path to\nhdf5_hl.a. Thanks for providing a reproducible example that made this easier to\ndebug.\n\nI've also added patching of other cmake targets files that included the wrong\npaths (both \"valid\" full msys2 paths, which however don't work with cmake, as\nwell as full path not valid after Rtools is installed).\n\nI've not tried to trace this up to the original place where the incorrect paths\nare generated, I can't allocate time for that, and in the cases when I tried\nthis in the past, it actually was quite hard. If you have the energy to trace\nthat and propose fixes to the upstream projects, that would of course be highly\nappreciated.\n\nA broader context is that pre-compiled libraries, which are part of Rtools, are\ncross-compiled using (slightly modified) MXE on Linux. Therefore, paths also in\ncmake files are absolute paths on that Unix system. Cmake has documented\napproaches how to create paths that are relocatable, and when that is used\ncorrectly, absolute paths are re-computed\/re-adjusted on the target system.\nSome software doesn't do this or doesn't do this correctly or doesn't do this\nfor all libraries correctly (and probably it is not tested).\n\nAnother difference from Msys2 is that MXE\/Rtools use static libraries. Again,\nexternal software is sometimes not maintained well for static libraries. It may\nnot be necessarily related to the problems reported here, but it might be, as\nthere are more dependencies to compute when using static libraries, and other\ncmake code paths may be taken.\n\nSo it is not surprising that some cmake files don't work in MXE\/Rtools but work\nin Msys2.\n\nPkg-config files have similar problems and are also being fixed when building\nRtools. But they are more tested as it is the primary way of finding\nconfiguration in MXE itself (yet, again, not exclusive, some software uses\ncmake).",

(in fact, we could simplify a bit further and\ndrop the `if()` since `c(..., character())` will just drop the empty input, but\nI left it as is to keep the parallel structure).\n\nPS for purely internal, minor things like this, I'm still not sure the\npreferred way to report among (1) discuss first on r-devel [way too high\nbarrier for an internal change IMO] (2) file on Bugzilla [might give the\nimpression this is a \"bug\" when strictly speaking nothing's \"broken\"] (3) reach\nout to a single R-core member responsible for recent changes in this part of\nthe code [I think it's best to avoid that except for highly-specific work in\none member's core area of expertise]",
