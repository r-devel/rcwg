Still stuck on what might have gone wrong.\n\nCan you fill us in a little on your workflow? It seems like something like this has happened (not sure):\n\n• You updated your .pot file past the .svn source-of-truth locally and translated based on that\n• You uploaded your translated .po file to Weblate as well as passing it directly to Michael L\nIs that right and is there anything else about your approach that we should know about? Any info can help debugging. Thanks!",
