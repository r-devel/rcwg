Implementing these best practices is something we can work on in the upcoming R Dev Days (Oct 7-8, UK; <https:\/\/pretix.eu\/r-contributors\/r-dev-day-oz-25\/|Nov 21, Australia>, Dec 16-17, Auckland \/ Virtual) and something that others could contribute to once we can get issues set up (or even before!). We do have a <https:\/\/github.com\/orgs\/r-devel\/teams\/translations|GitHub translations team> who should probably be CODEOWNERS for the translations repo.\n• The french translation has historically been led by Philippe Grosjean via <https:\/\/github.com\/phgrosjean\/rfrench>, which I see Christian has contributed to. Philippe is not on this Slack, but he is on our GitHub translations team and also on Weblate, so I would definitely recommend Christian to liaise with Philippe to ensure Weblate translations are kept in sync with GitHub contributions (going forward we would recommend to use Weblate, but external translations can be uploaded to Weblate with control over how to handle conflicts).\n• We continue to work on maintaining a common glossary across languages and across translation projects.
