Usually they relate to bugs that have been reported in base R, but sometimes also new issues proposed by an R Core developer or an experienced contributor.  \n   • Tasks are tagged by the general category (e.g. \"I\/O\" for issues related to input (reading data) or output (saving or printing output); \"Add-ons\" for issues related to add-on R packages, etc), what needs doing (e.g. \"needs patch\" for issues that require proposed changes to the code; \"needs analysis\" for issues that need more exploration first, e.g. debugging), \"C\" if the issue requires knowledge of C and an event label (e.g. \"RR 2025\" for R Dev Day @ Rencontres R)  \n         • Currently only a few issues tagged `RR 2025` - quite ambitious ones proposed by R Core developer Kurt Hornik. Will be adding more in coming week, including more that don't require knowledge of C!  \n         • Some issues may not have an event tag, but be tagged \"unassigned\" - can be taken up any time! - or \"assigned\" - assigned to a contributor outside of a Dev Day.  \n   • Recommend to review issues for the event in advance if possible, but will have time at the start of the Dev Day  \n   • Can express interest by assigning yourself to issue (must be a member of R Dev Days team of the R-devel GitHub organization, contact Heather if you need adding), or commenting on issue.  \n   • On the day itself, will use a Google sheet for people to help form small groups around the proposed issues.\n\n### <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day\/issues\/19|R Dev Days Issue 19>: Enabling strings for Windows installer to be added to Weblate\n\n• Briefly introduced the Weblate translation platform to give some background\n• Reviewed the task described in issue 19\n• Avinab got a bit further, has tried to make minimal changes to the source code, but still facing problems compiling the installer with these changes  \n   • Suggest to add a comment with the error on the issue  \n   • Also share changes, either by creating a patch, or using the GitHub mirror to make the changes on a fork. Both processes are described in the R Dev Guide section <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/rdevguide\/chapters\/lifecycle_of_a_patch.html#how-to-prepare-a-patch|How to prepare a patch>\n\n### <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-env\/issues\/196|R Dev Container Issue 196>: Try to get lldb working\n\n• Briefly introduced the R Dev Container, opening example instance with GitHub Codespaces.\n• Reviewed the task in issue 196: enabling debugging of C code in the container with lldb. Avinab has a solution that fixes the issues described, but it is not ideal as it introduces security risks. This may be the tradeoff we need to accept as we do want to permit C debugging, but we should investigate further to see if there is a better way.",
