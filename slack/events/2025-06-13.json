As Ella was short on time, Heather took on the job of getting the tests to run.\n• Heather managed to run the tests, but hit several issues with getting the right set-up on macOS, as packages needed to be installed from source in the development version of R.  \nShe was able to resolve most, but not all of these issues. Thankfully the remaining issues only affected installing {ragg}, one of the suggested dependencies of ggplot2,  \nwhich was not critical to include for this patch, as the original bug was not affected by choice of graphics device.\n• Heather shared some working notes. As there as many macOS-specific issues, probably related to Heather's specific set-up, the notes are probably not appropriate for adding to the R Dev Guide.  \nElla suggested adding them to the working_documents folder of R Contribution Working Group GitHub repository [Post-meeting note: they are now in <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/rcwg\/tree\/main\/working_documents>].\n• Ella noted that the updated patch had already been committed by Paul Murrell, following Heather's report back on Bugzilla after running the tests.",
