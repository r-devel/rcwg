In October I'm attending mini-workshops on various themes, with some associated coursework - mainly reflection on how this relates to our work.\n\nThis week was on Giving and Receiving Feedback and I've put my draft reflections here: <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1DYv-qhe_KS5pebjyuVANHMewoQ5tU-0s1xal9oZmHZY\/edit?usp=sharing>. Feel free to comment:\n• Are there any places\/times we give or receive feedback that I've missed? (Current examples include discussions on <#C01FDG8C5TJ|patches-for-review>, review of PRs on GitHub).\n• If you're familiar with the feedback frameworks, do you have any reflections to add? (I can't share the course slides outside the cohort, but I've linked to other resources discussing the different frameworks).\nI'll be submitting our response by Wednesday afternoon (UTC) next week.",
