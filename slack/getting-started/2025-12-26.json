I’m really interested in this direction and am currently spending time understanding the framework, algorithms, and existing code.\n\nI wanted to ask if there are any *small tasks or contributions* (e.g., documentation, tests, visualizations, or minor code improvements) that would be helpful for the project and suitable for someone getting deeper into gfpop, with the longer-term goal of working on time-dependent constraints.\n\nAny guidance on good starting points would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks, and I’m excited to learn and contribute!",
