This is to review <https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/web\/packages\/rockchalk\/vignettes\/Rstyle.pdf>, which gives guidance on style based on studying the source code of R and CRAN packages, along with an SEA score (\"Subjective and completely unscientific personal Estimate of Agreement.\" :smile:). The SEA score gives an indication of how consistently that style is used in the R codebase. We could consider extending the documentation to cover anything with an SEA &gt; 0.9 or thereabouts. If you could read the PDF, identify these items and cross-check if we already have them documented or not, that would be useful.",
