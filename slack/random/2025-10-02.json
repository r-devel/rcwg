From what I'm reading in the <http:\/\/configure.ac|configure.ac> file, it seems as if pkg-config is a hard requirement to compile\/build R itself. It may be a suggestion for users, but I see it being necessary to configure certain components. Other dependencies are configured with pkg-config _if_ they are available. I wanted to confirm whether this is true: pkg-config is a hard requirement for building\/compiling R.",
