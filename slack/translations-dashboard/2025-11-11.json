We have a lot of people attending R Dev Day @ Australia next week (40 in person plus potentially as many remote participants) and it would be great to get substantial work done on the dashboard. I will create an issue related to the refactoring of the code underlying the GitHub Actions. But it would also be good to add issues that could be worked on in parallel. I think we could get people to:\n\n1. Finish off <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/translations-dashboard\/issues\/49> by adding READMEs (or maybe someone here could do that in advance?)\n2. Convert the dashboard (as is) to Quarto \n3. Improve data visualizations to make them useful for the final users\n4. Work on documentation and governance (<https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/translations-dashboard\/issues\/40>) - README, CONTRIBUTORS.md, CODEOWNERS, etc\nI think #3 would particularly make sense, given the expertise at Monash (Di Cook and her PhD students\/postdocs, Natalia da Silva visiting). We could add people from the RSECon25 team as reviewers to keep you in the loop. If that's okay I'll set up issues accordingly.",
