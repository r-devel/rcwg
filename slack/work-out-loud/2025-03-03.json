The error you are getting from `make` suggests you many not be in the right directory when you are calling `make`, so it's not finding the make file.\n\nIf you haven't tried this already, I would start by trying to build R from source without making any changes to the source code. That way, you can focus on ensuring you have the right pre-requisites, are following the instructions correctly etc, without possibly hitting issues due to changes you are making.\n\nI would try following the instructions in the R Dev Guide for building on Windows: <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/rdevguide\/chapters\/getting_started.html#windowsSource>, starting from scratch (of course making sure to save the work you have done on the `.islu` files and `header1.iss`, hopefully that will come in useful later). These instructions were originally linked on the R Dev Day issue, but the link has changed, so I've just updated it.\n\nHopefully that helps you to make some progress. Once you can build R, then try building the installer. If that all works, then you can try changing the source code to address the actual issue!\n\nI don't think that you should be making any changes in the Inno Setup installation directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Inno Setup 6`), rather I would expect changes to happen in your local copy of  `r-svn\/src\/gnuwin32\/installer\/`, where the files for the R Windows installer are, including some `.isl` files (which would need to be updated to `.islu` for compatibility with Weblate.",
